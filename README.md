# PyZork
This repository is a fully featured text-based adventure game based off the Zork anthology. Players will have the ability to play with the included Zork-I map or create and play their own maps if so desired. I am admittly an amateur Python programmer, and really only doing this as a hobby. Any help and/or suggestions are greatly appriciated!
