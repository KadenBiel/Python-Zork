# PyZork
This repository is a fully featured text-based adventure game based off the Zork anthology. Players will have the ability to play with the included Zork-I map or create and play their own maps if so desired. I am admittly an amateur Python programmer, and really only doing this as a hobby. Any help and/or suggestions are greatly appriciated!

# Contributions
Everything is written using python 3.7 in visual studio so far, I would recommend doing the same. Clone this repository and create your own branch then push your contributions to your branch and create a pull request.

# Dowloads
There is a website, pyzork.tk, for the latest releases. This program is still in the Alpha stages, as I work to create full support for user created maps and clone the existing Zork-1 map to include with the program. You can also find a little pygame DVD screen saver for download on this wesite, not quite sure what the use for it is though.
